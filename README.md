# Contact Less Attendance With Mask Detection and QR Codes based on Face Recognization

This system marks contactless attendance in the following steps:
1) Mask Detection 
The system detects if the person is wearing a mask. If yes, then the system marks the attendance of the person, if not, then the system displays a message to wear a mask, untill then, the system won't mark attendance
2) QR Code 
The system will recognize the QR code that the user will point towards the screen. 
3) Face Recognition
Once the QR code is detected for the particular user, then the face of the user will be detected, if the concerned user is present before the camera, then the attendance will be marked
